Notes:
Use an adapted version of the Elo rating system which takes into account how
well the winning team outperformed their opponents. A team with a much higher
rating would be expected to win by more than one point, but teams closer in
ratings should see games closer to a 1-goal difference.

In the NHL, there are no ties, so the minimum difference between goals is 1.

Pre-season and post-season games should see smaller changes in rating. What
should the weights be?

At the beginning of new seasons, inflate the sigma for each team to account
for new team compositions (coaches, players, whatever) and then begin to
reduce to normal levels. This gives the opportunities for underpeforming teams
in a previous season to not be penalized too heavily in the current season.
Meaning, they may have improved. This is also requires that strong teams would
need to maintain their strength and aren't given a free pass.

I couldn't figure out how to tell whether the games went to overtime/shootout.

Consider having separate ratings based on:
  1. Goals, i.e. the actual outcome of the game
  2. Shots
  3. Difference between takeaways and giveaways
The last two might, I hope, be useful as some kind of ancillary ratings.
